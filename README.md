# Baseball-Slugging and Silver Sluggers
My replication package for my stats class STA-145 final project. I looked at the last 2 decades of the baseball team New York Yankees and the players that composed the team. I took the 2 variables career slug average and if they ever won the silver slugger award. Looking to see if their was a correlation between these 2 and if a higher slug average leads to winning the award. 
# Data
The data collected for this project was player statistics and player awards. I used mostly fangraphs to find my data on the players and their career stats.
